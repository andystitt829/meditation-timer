    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Here are a few tips for using this timer and your meditation practice as a whole.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="ion-margin">Whatever position you're most comfortable in is the best position to meditate. It could be sitting, laying down, or even walking.</li>
        <li class="ion-margin">The more you meditate, the more you get out of it. However, even if you miss a day, a week, or even a year, the best gift you can give yourself is getting back to it without self-judgment.</li>
        <li class="ion-margin">You can meditate with your eyes open or closed, whichever is most comfortable for you.</li>
        <li class="ion-margin">If you've never meditated before, start by focusing on your breath. Focus on breathing in, then focus on breathing out.</li>
        <li class="ion-margin">Your mind will wander when you meditate. That's what minds do. The best thing to do is to notice that your mind has wandered and then come back to your breath or whatever the focus of your meditation is.</li>
    </ul>
